# Boussinesq
Matlab/Octave language -Calculus of soil tension distribution due to traffic load under Boussinesq theory - Eurocode Models 
This code was developed in Octave/Matlab language in order to calcul the tension under traffic loads following the Eurocode Model LM1. It can be modified to implement other models, in funcion of national norms or rules or specific problems.
Output is a 3D plot of tensions under surface and a graph that presents the maximum tension at different depth due to overimposition of loads.
